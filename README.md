# PRODIGY_SD_01

## Task Description
This repository contains the code and documentation for my first task in the Software Development track of my internship. The task involves creating a program for temperature conversion between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The implementation is done in C++.

## File Description
- `TemperatureConversion.cpp`: The main C++ file that contains the implementation of the temperature conversion program.

## How to Run
To run the temperature conversion program, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheeArghya/PRODIGY_SD_01.git
   cd PRODIGY_SD_01
2. **Compile the C++ program:**
Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (like g++). Compile the program using the following command:
```bash
g++ TemperatureConversion.cpp -o TemperatureConversion
```
4. **Run the compiled program:**
```bash
./TemperatureConversion
```

5. **Program Usage:**
The program will prompt you to enter a temperature value.
Next, you will be asked to enter the unit of the temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).
The program will then display the converted temperatures in the other two units.
Example

```
Enter the Temperature Value: 25
Enter the unit of the temperature (case sensitive):
Celsius
Fahrenheit
Kelvin
Enter your Choice ->>>>>> 
Celsius
The temperature in Fahrenheit is 77
The temperature in Kelvin is 298.15
```

5. **Requirements**
C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
Basic knowledge of C++ and terminal commands
